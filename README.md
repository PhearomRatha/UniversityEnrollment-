1. Problem Statement
Many students face difficulties with the current university enrollment system:
  •	Long queues at the finance office waste valuable time.
  •	Physical payment receipts can be lost.
  •	Announcements are limited to Telegram, making updates slow.
  •	No online access to enrollment status.
This affects almost all students, especially those with busy schedules or those who live far away. To solve this, we propose a University Enrollment App that allows students to:
  •	Pay tuition fees online.
  •	Get automatic digital receipts.
  •	Check enrollment status anytime.
  •	Access university announcements and news quickly.
  •	View class schedules and student details easily.

2. User Stories

  •	As a student, I want to check my enrollment status so I know if my payment is confirmed.
